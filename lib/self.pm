=head1 NAME

self - provides '$self' in OO code.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes self version 0.30.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyModule;
    use self;

    # Write constructor as usual
    sub new {
        return bless({}, shift);
    }

    # '$self' is special now.
    sub foo {
        $self->{foo}
    }

    # '@args' too
    sub set {
        my ($foo, $bar) = @args;
        $self->{foo} = $foo;
        $self->{bar} = $bar;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds C<$self> and C<@args> variables in your code. So you
don't need to say:

    my $self = shift;

The provided C<$self> and C<@args> are lexicals in your sub, and it's
always the same as saying:

    my ($self, @args) = @_;

... in the first line of sub.

However it is not source filtering, but compile-time code
injection. For more info about code injection, see L<B::Hooks::Parser>
or L<Devel::Declare>.

It also exports a C<self> and a C<args> functions. Basically C<self> is just
equal to C<$_[0]>, and C<args> is just C<$_[1..$#_]>.

For convienence (and backward compatibility), these two functions
are exported by default. If you don't want them to be exported, you
need to say:

    use self ();

Since self.pm uses L<Sub::Exporter>, the exported <self> funciton
can be renamed:

    use self self => { -as => 'this' };

For more information, see L<Sub::Exporter>.

It is recommended to use variables instead, because it's much much
faster. There's a benchmark program under "example" directory compare
them: Here's one example run:

    > perl -Ilib examples/benchmark.pl
              Rate  self $self
    self   46598/s    --  -92%
    $self 568182/s 1119%    --

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item $self, or self

Return the current object.

=item @args, or args

Return the argument list.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

self.pm requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

C<B::OPCheck>, C<Devel::Declare>, C<Sub::Exporter>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

In some cases, C<$self> and C<@args> may failed to be injected.

If you're using 0.30, please ensure that your sub declaration has its
'{' at the same line like this:

    sub foo {
    }

Also it's ok to have the entire sub in one line:

    sub foo { }

Please upgrade to 0.31 if you prefer this style of code:

   sub foo
   {
       $self;
   }

Extra spaces around sub declarations are handled as much as possible,
if you found any cases that it failed to work, please send me bug
reports with your test cases.

It does not work on methods generated in runtime. Remember, it's a
compile-time code injection. For those cases, use C<self> function
instead.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-self@rt.cpan.org>,
or through the web interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
